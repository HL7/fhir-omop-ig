== Suppressed Messages ==

# Add warning and/or information messages here after you've confirmed that they aren't really a problem
# (And include comments like this justifying why)
# See https://github.com/FHIR/sample-ig/blob/master/input/ignoreWarnings.txt for examples

# 01 - Various FML functions that throw warnings
Transform copy not checked yet
Transform cast not checked yet

# 02 - It is intended not to assign a variable
The source statement doesn't assign a variable to the source - check that this is what is intended

# 03 - This has been verified to be the actual FHIRPath expression needed to make the transform work.  The error is incorrect.
The FHIRPath expression passed as the evaluate parameter is invalid: Error evaluating FHIRPath expression: The name 'src' is not valid for any of the possible types: [http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Person] (@char 1)

# 04 - Deprecated value set is used in FHIR core
Reference to deprecated ValueSet http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/jurisdiction|5.0.0

# 05 - Codesystem is experimental but is used in IG
Reference to experimental CodeSystem http://hl7.org/fhir/guide-parameter-code|5.0.0

# 06 - This warning is all on Logical Models and we are matching the names of the elements in the OMOP tables.
Constraint failed: eld-20: 'The first component of the path should be UpperCamelCase.  Additional components (following a '.') should be lowerCamelCase.  If this syntax is not adhered to, code generation tools may be broken. Logical models may be less concerned about this implication.'
