# Strategies & Best Practices
## Data Provenance & Traceability
## Consistency & Standardization in Transformations
### Technical Implementation Strategies
Successful FHIR-to-OMOP implementations benefit from comprehensive ETL documentation that specifies mapping hierarchies and clearly articulates assumptions made during the transformation process. This documentation becomes particularly critical when dealing with multiple source systems that may handle temporal data differently or have varying levels of data completeness.
For organizations where audit requirements mandate robust provenance tracking, designing custom OMOP extensions specifically for recorded date preservation represents a strategic investment in data governance capabilities. These extensions should be carefully planned to avoid conflicts with standard OMOP conventions while providing the necessary metadata for compliance and quality assurance processes.


### Practical Applications and Use Cases
The distinction between these temporal concepts becomes most apparent when considering their respective applications in healthcare analytics and operations. Condition start dates serve as the foundation for clinical research initiatives, outcomes analysis projects, and temporal cohort definitions where understanding the natural history of disease is essential. These applications require temporal precision that reflects biological and clinical reality rather than administrative convenience.
Conversely, recorded dates prove invaluable for data governance initiatives, ETL validation processes, documentation pattern analysis, and regulatory compliance activities. These applications focus on understanding and improving healthcare delivery processes, audit trails, and operational efficiency rather than clinical outcomes.
The successful implementation of FHIR-to-OMOP transformations requires careful balance between OMOP's clinical data model philosophy and the comprehensive provenance tracking needs of modern healthcare organizations. By understanding these temporal concepts and their appropriate applications, health data professionals can design robust, scalable solutions that serve both clinical and operational stakeholders effectively.
