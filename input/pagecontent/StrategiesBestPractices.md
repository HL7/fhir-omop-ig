## Consistency & Standardization in Transformations
### Technical Implementation Strategies
Successful FHIR-to-OMOP implementations benefit from comprehensive ETL documentation that specifies mapping hierarchies and clearly articulates assumptions made during the transformation process. This documentation becomes particularly critical when dealing with multiple source systems that may handle temporal data differently or have varying levels of data completeness.
For organizations where audit requirements mandate robust provenance tracking, designing custom OMOP extensions specifically for recorded date preservation represents a strategic investment in data governance capabilities. These extensions should be carefully planned to avoid conflicts with standard OMOP conventions while providing the necessary metadata for compliance and quality assurance processes.



The successful implementation of FHIR-to-OMOP transformations requires careful balance between OMOP's clinical data model philosophy and the comprehensive provenance tracking needs of modern healthcare organizations. By understanding these temporal concepts and their appropriate applications, health data professionals can design robust, scalable solutions that serve both clinical and operational stakeholders effectively.
