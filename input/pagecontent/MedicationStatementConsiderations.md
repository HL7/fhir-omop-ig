# MedicationStatement Resource Considerations
The FHIR MedicationStatement resource represents documented or observed medication intake, providing evidence that is closer to actual drug exposure than prescription data or medication histories alone. When implementing MedicationStatement to OMOP drug_exposure mappings, consider MedicationStatement data as closer to confirmed exposure than MedicationRequest, but apply appropriate caution for self-reported information. The mapping should preserve temporal information through effectiveDate, maintain medication coding through mapping to Standard OMOP concepts, document status information for research context, and utilize appropriate drug_type_concept_id values to reflect the data's provenance. This approach balances the enhanced exposure evidence that MedicationStatement provides while maintaining appropriate skepticism about data quality inherent in patient-reported medication information and ensuring proper categorization for downstream analysis.

While MedicationStatement represents stronger evidence of exposure compared to MedicationRequest, implementers should recognize that this data may vary in reliability. Patient-reported data can involve recall bias, and retrospective statements may not capture exact intake dates. The implementation guide recommends treating MedicationStatement data with attention to these limitations while acknowledging its superiority over purely prescriptive data.

## Core Field Mappings
### EffectiveDate
The effectiveDate field in MedicationStatement represents the date or time period when the medication was reportedly taken or administered. This temporal information is crucial as it provides data closer to actual exposure than prescription dates alone. The effectiveDate should map to drug_exposure.start_date in OMOP, and when an end date is included in the effectiveDate period, it should map to drug_exposure.end_date. This field represents a date range that aligns with the observed or reported period of medication intake, providing researchers with temporal boundaries for exposure analysis.

### Medication (CodeableConcept)
The medication field captures the specific drug or medication name, typically coded using standard terminologies such as RxNorm or SNOMED. This field should map directly to drug_concept_id in OMOP when a recognized concept ID is available. In cases where a medication code is missing, free-text entries can be used as non-standard concepts. When MedicationStatement references a separate Medication resource, the mapping should incorporate data from that referenced resource to capture complete medication details accurately.

### Dosage Instructions
Dosage instructions within MedicationStatement provide detailed information on the amount, frequency, and route of administration. These elements should map to dose_unit_concept_id, dose_value, and route_concept_id in OMOP. Any specific administration instructions can be preserved in the SIG field within drug_exposure. This mapping is particularly valuable for research studies requiring analysis of drug exposure quantity and frequency patterns.

## Additional Implementation Considerations
### Status Variability Considerations
Given that MedicationStatement may represent retrospective statements or patient-reported intake, implementers should document that a medicationStatment status and effectiveDate may vary in reliability. Research teams should be encouraged to consider these limitations when designing studies, particularly when dealing with patient-reported data that may be subject to recall bias or incomplete documentation.

## Drug Type Concept ID Utilization
The drug_type_concept_id field in OMOP serves a critical role in differentiating the provenance and nature of drug exposure records. When mapping FHIR MedicationStatement resources to the drug_exposure table, implementers must carefully select the appropriate drug_type_concept_id to distinguish between prescribed medications, administered medications, medication histories, and patient-reported exposures. This classification enables downstream users to appropriately filter and interpret data based on their analytical needs. When mapping MedicationStatement data, implementers should choose the drug_type_concept_id that best represents the provenance of the record. The [accepted concepts](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?domain=Type+Concept&standardConcept=Standard&page=1&pageSize=15&query=) provide standardized options for delineating between prescriptions written, prescriptions dispensed, medication history, and patient-reported exposure. For MedicationStatement resources, the type concept should typically reflect patient-reported exposure or medication history, depending on the source and context of the data.

The OMOP CDM focuses exclusively on events that occur to the patient, meaning actions that suggest the drug was actually administered. If a patient missed or refused a dose of medication, no record should be created in the CDM. This principle guides the selection of drug_type_concept_id values, ensuring that only meaningful exposure events are captured in the database.

### Dosage Change Considerations
When medication dosages change during a treatment period, the mapping should end the first record and create a new record with the updated quantity. This approach ensures that each drug_exposure record represents a consistent dosage regimen, providing accurate temporal and quantitative information for analysis. The drug_type_concept_id should remain consistent across these records unless the nature of the data source changes.
