## Handling of Procedure and Observation Resources
Naturally, there is variability in source EHR data representation, where each EHR may represent the same clinical activity differently when exported to FHIR. For instance, some procedures in FHIR are represented in the Measurements or Observations domains in OMOP, such as lab orders and diagnostic imaging. It is a mapping challenge in deciding whether to map individual activities to the OMOP Procedure Occurrence, Measurement, or Observation domains. As alluded to previously, this is determined by domain assignment of the target OMOP concept_id(s) for any given procedure represented on FHIR.  An evaluation of each source procedure that differentiates true procedures (e.g., surgeries) from diagnostic activities is necessary to avoid FHIR procedure resource data misclassification.

## Handling Encounters and Contextual Data
In FHIR, procedures, medications, and other clinical actions are often linked to an encounter for context. OMOP has Visit Occurrence and Visit Detail tables that provide temporal and venue-specific clinical context.  However, inconsistencies in how encounters are represented across FHIR resources and systems present challenges to consistent data transformation. Mapping encounter data to OMOPâ€™s visit_occurrence table and populating other domains with a visit_occurence_concept_id foreign key should be done wherever possible.  However, an evaluation of how consistent the source data are in representing encounters will determine whether there may be some flexibility required in a FHIR to OMOP transformation.
