# Specific Issues when Transforming FHIR to OMOP
Challenges arise aligning  FHIR resources and the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) due to differences in data structures and the underlying scope and purpose when using each in deployed systems.   An additional layer of complexity lies in the fact that few observational data sources are generated as native FHIR, so many FHIR resources have previously undergone a transformation onto FHIR in support of data exchange scenarios. As such, there is a need for a pragmatic approach to aligning FHIR and OMOP that preserves not only key context of the source data represented in a formation that supports transactional use cases, but also attains conformance to OMOP as a target specification supporting analytics. 

Given the inherent differences in scope and purpose of the two models, this implementation guide focuses on high-confidence mappings, providing annotation in areas where assumptions are made.  Our goal is to provide rationale and clear conventions where details applicable to all cases of FHIR to OMOP transformations may be lacking. This guide is intended to be the foundation upon which refinement addressing specific use cases can be based.  Testing at Connectathons and standard HL7 user feedback processes will validate and / or enhance our proposed strategies and ensure the conventions and mappings provided are robust and practical for a variety of use cases.
FHIR by design supports real-time clinical data exchange within healthcare systems, emphasizing data interoperability and clinical workflows. OMOP is structured for research and analytics, focusing on retrospective analysis and standardized terminology. The implication of these differences includes that under-considered or incomplete mappings can misrepresent data because FHIR's real-time, workflow-oriented approach doesn’t always align with OMOP’s longitudinal approach to data.  The OMOP approach and data model requires compliance to concept standardization and assumes that data has been validated by data quality procedures ensuring its consistency. Specific aspects of patient records on FHIR that require special consider when transforming to OMOP follow.

## Identifiers, De-identitification & Privacy
As is customary for relational databases, identifiers in the OMOP Common Data Model are used to establish relationships between tables. Notably, the person_id is used as a foreign key in OMOP to link conditions, procedures, drug exposures and other clinical domain tables. However, data residing on OMOP is de-identified as a default where no fields contain data that are patient identifiable information (PII), such as Medical Record Numbers, names or addresses. In FHIR, identifiers provide a similar function in that they link discrete data occurring in separate FHIR resources to individual patients, but identifiers in FHIR also provide reference information about and / or residing in the source systems that generate data in FHIR resources to support workflows and transactions between systems.  In practice, many OMOP implementations reside within system architectures that have business requirements for re-identification supporting learning health systems scenarios, research recruitment or other use cases.   For these instances, maintaining traceability from OMOP back to the FHIR source could be crucial for continuous learning and other virtuous feedback loops leveraging the use of observational data. Simply stated, there is not a single approach that we can provide in the scope identified for this guide that can be uniformly applied to transformation of FHIR identifiers to OMOP.  Rather, implementers must evaluate FHIR identifiers in terms of 

* Research the OMOP instance is intended to support
* Purpose / role of the identifier in the FHIR resource
* Whether the FHIR identifier may, in fact, inform clinical facts in the observational data store
* Format (length) of the identifier

A primary concern when implementing FHIR to OMOP transformations that include raw identifiers directly from source systems is in doing so, there could be compromises in the de-identification process: a cornerstone of OMOP's design for use in research and analytics. OMOP is not designed to support business identity management use cases, and using fields like `visit_source_value` to store FHIR identifiers could misrepresent their intended use as generated in source EHRs. A potential solution is to ignore identifiers in the direct mapping process or stored in a separate structure outside of OMOP’s core tables to maintain traceability.  Creating a separate data source table that maps OMOP-generated IDs to the original FHIR identifiers can accommodate the complexities of handling identifiers for retaining provenance and traceability without compromising the de-identification and usability standards, disrupting the OMOP schema or violating its de-identification protocols.

Implementers of FHIR to OMOP transformations must balance how an identifier presents in the source FHIR resource(s), the technical requirements and permissible use of OMOP per the CDM specification. This involves choosing how to manage identifiers based on the specific needs and system constraints of the implementation, while maintaining compliance with data privacy and usability standards.  More specifically, differing database systems such as Google BigQuery, AWS Redshift… have varying constraints on integer sizes. This may complicate storing FHIR identifiers directly as OMOP IDs. It can also be challenging to find a suitable place for these identifiers within the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM), which does not have a direct equivalent field specifically designed for business identifiers associated with encounters.

An example of this type of challenge is apparent when evaluating the ‘encounter.identifier’ element in the FHIR Encounter resource.  This element captures a business identifier for the encounter, which in any source data may reflect a variety of identifiers such as medical record numbers, encounter IDs, or any unique values used by healthcare systems to track individual encounters. One solution would be to use `visit_occurrence_id`as a target in OMOP, as this is a unique identifier for each record in the `visit_occurrence` table aligned with the meaning of the data element in FHIR. However, in consideration for the need for traceability, data integrity, and compliance with de-identification standards, this primary key is typically generated in OMOP as a sequence to ensure anonymity and maintain referential integrity across the OMOP instance. Another solution would be to map FHIR `Encounter.identifier` to the OMOP`visit_source_value`a field that can hold the original value from the source data that describes the encounter type. However, depending on the convention used for generating this identifier in source upstream of FHIR, there are concerns regarding the appropriateness of using this field for identifiers, which are not descriptive values but unique business identifiers. Further, `visit_source_value` in OMOP often aligns more with descriptive elements in FHIR like `Encounter.period` or `Encounter.type`, which are codeable concepts in FHIR and not necessarily identifiers. 

There could be limitations to the ability of fields in an OMOP database to store some identifiers, particularly GUIDs or more complex strings that exceed, for example, the varchar(50) character limit specified in `visit_source_value.`  Identifiers in source systems may have missing context resulting in ambiguous meanings such as reflected in the following

  ```json
       "identifier": [
         {
           "system": "https://hospital.makedata.ai",
           "value": "b9d8ed9e-1b1a-4e30-9ee3-af66f4a61cff"
         }
       ]
```

Additionally, identifiers can be complex with nested elements:

       ```xml
       <identifier>
         <use value="official" />
         <system value="http://www.acmehosp.com/patients" />
         <value value="44552" />
         <period>
           <start value="2003-05-03" />
         </period>
       </identifier>
       ```
These examples highlight the complexity and variability of identifiers in FHIR, emphasizing why a one-size-fits-all mapping in OMOP is not practical. As such we recommend an evaluation on a case-by-case basis of the available FHIR identifier elements and their meaning in the source system to determine an appropriate target in OMOP, adoption of a separate facility or extension table(s) with the express purpose of storing source identifiers or ignoring them in the transformation altogether. 
## Status and Intent of FHIR Resources
Many FHIR resources, like MedicationRequest or Procedure, have status fields indicating administrative or health care delivery process stages (e.g., planned, completed, in progress).  OMOP, on the other hand, represents concepts that are clinical facts, which implies that only completed activities should be mapped for accurate data analysis. This creates an expectation of specific context for the data being mapped. Careful consideration must be made when FHIR data resources also contain populated status and intent fields indicating a measurement, dispensing activity or care delivery service is planned or in process.  Specifically, attention to and disposition of data based on these FHIR elements in a transformation should be consistent within a project or OMOP implementation.  Upon evaluation, there may be a need to filter out incomplete or planned activities when transforming data to OMOP, especially for procedures and medications. Including such data could introduce bias or misrepresent actual patient exposure, leading to inaccuracies in research.  This kind of filtering and its rationale should be documented so that the rules are applied consistently to data ingress pipelines for as long as the OMOP instance is in use. 

The business context of FHIR Medication Requests versus the OMOP Drug Exposure domain is an example where representation and evaluation of the medication status is needed as a component of a properly executed data transformation. FHIR MedicationRequests resources represent prescriptions  or orders, which do not in and of themselves guarantee that the patient actually ingested the medications. In contrast, OMOP’s drug_exposure table is intended to capture actual medication exposure. But medication orders and prescriptions are commonly used in observational research as assumed proxies for exposure to medications.  As such, particular attention must be made to populate the required drug_exposure entries derived from MedicationRequest data through assignment of an appropriate drug_type_concept_id that clearly indicates the data are derived from a prescription rather than known ingestion. This approach allows downstream users to filter based on what is known to be true about the exposure to a medication and retain valuable prescribing or dispensing records in the research data store. 

## Data Completeness, Missiness &  Integrity
### Granularity of FHIR Data vs. OMOP Standardization
FHIR resources can contain detailed data, such as dosage adjustments or specific intervals for medication administration, which might not have direct counterparts in OMOP’s more generalized tables. An implication for data transformation is that this disparity means some FHIR data may be lost or generalized in the transformation process to OMOP.  This could impact specific use cases. When developing a data transformation from FHIR to OMOP, there is a need to document potential data losses resulting from a mismatch in source to target data granularity to inform data users about impacts to, and potential limitations this may cause in analyses.

### Handling Incomplete or Partial Data
Handling incomplete or partial data presents an additional challenge in transforming FHIR resources to OMOP. FHIR records are often incomplete for several reasons: the source electronic health record (EHR) itself may contain partial entries, or the FHIR resources may only include a subset of available data tailored to the specific purpose of the resource. In contrast, the OMOP data model assumes that critical fields such as dates, person references, and coded concepts are consistently populated to support standardized analysis.

When transforming FHIR to OMOP, these gaps require careful consideration to avoid introducing ambiguity or bias. For example, a FHIR MedicationStatement may be missing start or end dates, which makes it unclear whether the medication should be interpreted as active, historical, or intended. Similarly, a procedure or encounter record may lack information about the performer or the location, undermining the ability to analyze provider performance, regional variation, or care delivery patterns.

One approach to address these challenges is to consider fallback strategies that preserve as much context as possible. Implementers can use the OMOP observation domain or the note table to retain essential but incomplete data when no direct mapping is feasible. In cases where fields such as dates are missing, records can be flagged as incomplete by selecting appropriate ‘type’ concept IDs to indicate that the data is estimated or partial. This practice ensures that analysts reviewing the transformed data are aware of the uncertainty inherent in these records.

It is equally important for implementers to reflect on the implications of partial data for downstream analyses. Records with incomplete information may introduce misinterpretation or bias if not carefully accounted for in study design and statistical modeling. Therefore, teams should exercise caution when drawing inferences from datasets containing records transformed from incomplete FHIR sources.

### Flavors of Null on OMOP

### Temporal Completeness and Missing Dates
Temporal information in FHIR plays a critical role in accurately representing the timing and sequence of healthcare events. However, mapping this information into the OMOP data model can be challenging when dates are missing or ambiguous. FHIR resources often rely on elements such as effectiveDateTime, period, or endDate to define when an event occurred, but this information is frequently incomplete or approximate, especially in historical records or patient-reported data.

Missing or estimated dates introduce substantial risks to data quality and analytic precision. For example, when a FHIR Procedure resource lacks an end date, it becomes unclear whether the procedure was completed or remains ongoing, which complicates the construction of care timelines. Similarly, approximate dates can undermine the reliability of studies requiring precise event sequencing or duration calculations.

To mitigate these issues, implementers should explicitly document limitations in date precision. One approach is to record such records in the OMOP observation_period table or apply custom flags to indicate that date information is incomplete or uncertain. When dates are ambiguous, the Implementation Guide recommends using the recorded date as a proxy and reflecting the uncertainty by setting an appropriate observation_type_concept_id.

Where feasible, standard conventions should be applied to improve consistency. For example, if only a month is known, the date may default to the first day of that month. In cases where no precise day is available, a median estimate can be used to maintain temporal coherence while preserving clarity about the inherent limitations of the source data. These practices help ensure that analyses remain as robust as possible despite unavoidable gaps in temporal detail.

### Contextual Gaps in Data Mapping
A challenge faced in transforming FHIR to OMOP is that FHIR resources often contain contextual elements such as `reasonCode`, `performer`, `location`, or `supportingInfo` that help clarify the conditions or context surrounding a clinical event. OMOP tables do not have a direct way to represent these contexts fully in the same way that FHIR has structured this information. While core information may be mapped to OMOP fields in most instances, key context might be lost if certain contextual elements cannot be directly represented, impacting downstream analytics. For example, `reasonCode` in FHIR can specify the purpose of a procedure, such as preventive care vs. diagnostic intervention. This nuance can be critical to outcomes analyses but may not be directly captured in OMOP.  Also of issue is that lacking context, such as missing details on “why” a procedure was performed or medication prescribed could lead to misinterpretations in analysis, particularly for longitudinal studies tracking disease progression or treatment efficacy. 
   
One workaround could be to capture the context in an OMOP extension, such as "note," but this would have limitations.  Further, any extension suggested as universally applicable for FHIR source data would suggest implementation of OMOP CDM non-conformant as a routine. Rather, for the scope of this implementation guide, we want to call attention to the limitation and suggest review of the source data for potential proxies in the choices made for target Standard concepts, special attention to selection of record ‘type’ concepts that confer metadata about the source records or ensuring linkage in the transformed data to specific `visit_occurrence` records to approximate some context potentially lost. As suggested with identifiers, if the contextual information potentially lost in transformation cannot be accommodated and is critical to the research intended, then accommodation with concept or table extensions may be considered.
