# Condition and Probelm List Considerations
## Condition Start Date vs. Recorded Date
When implementing FHIR-to-OMOP transformations, two temporal concepts require careful consideration due to their distinct semantic meanings and downstream analytical impact. Understanding these differences is crucial for health data professionals working on interoperability projects and clinical data warehousing initiatives.

### Understanding Condition Start Date
The condition start date represents the clinically determined onset of the condition and forms the foundation of temporal analysis in clinical research. In FHIR implementations, this information is primarily sourced from Condition.onsetDateTime or Condition.onsetPeriod fields. When these explicit onset fields are unavailable, ETL developers often need to implement fallback logic that examines Condition.assertedDate or extract temporal information from clinical notes through natural language processing or manual extraction processes.
This temporal marker maps directly to CONDITION_OCCURRENCE.condition_start_date in the OMOP Common Data Model. The clinical significance of this field cannot be overstated, as it serves as the cornerstone for temporal analyses, disease progression modeling, and epidemiological cohort studies where clinical timeline accuracy is paramount for valid research outcomes.

### The Role of Recorded Date
In contrast to the clinical onset, the recorded date captures when the condition was actually documented in the source system. This administrative timestamp reflects the healthcare workflow and documentation practices rather than the clinical reality of disease onset. In FHIR resources, this information is typically found in Condition.recordedDate, though the availability of this field varies significantly across different EHR implementations and vendor configurations.
The challenge for OMOP implementers lies in the fact that the Common Data Model lacks a native equivalent field for recorded dates. This architectural decision reflects OMOP's focus on clinical events rather than administrative metadata. However, several implementation strategies can address this gap, including the development of custom extensions within the CONDITION_OCCURRENCE table, creation of dedicated metadata tables for comprehensive provenance tracking, utilization of the NOTE table with structured content, or establishment of separate ETL audit tables that maintain this temporal information alongside the clinical data.

### Implementation Challenges and Considerations
The fundamental challenge in FHIR-to-OMOP mapping stems from a data model alignment issue where OMOP's clinical-event focus prioritizes onset information over administrative timestamps. This philosophical difference requires architects and implementers to make deliberate decisions about how to preserve recorded date information when audit requirements or analytical needs demand such provenance tracking.
Missing data scenarios present particular complexity for ETL developers. When onsetDateTime is unavailable in the source FHIR data, the temptation exists to use recordedDate as a proxy for clinical onset. While this approach may seem pragmatic, it introduces analytical bias that can significantly impact downstream research and clinical decision-making. Such substitutions must be thoroughly documented in ETL metadata and clearly communicated to end users.
Temporal discrepancies between onset and documentation dates often reveal interesting patterns in healthcare delivery and documentation practices. Significant lags between when a condition clinically manifests and when it gets recorded in the EHR can affect different use cases in distinct ways, with clinical analyses requiring accurate onset timing while operational assessments may depend more heavily on documentation patterns.

### Condition Date Implementation Strategies
The implementation of date prioritization logic typically follows a preference hierarchy that favors onset dates when available while providing documented fallback mechanisms to recorded dates when clinical onset information is absent. This logic should be configurable to accommodate different analytical requirements and source system characteristics.
A technique that may be overlooked involves leveraging the condition_type_concept_id field to indicate the source and quality of temporal information. By using concept codes that distinguish between "EHR onset date" and "EHR recorded date," downstream analysts can make informed decisions about which temporal markers are most appropriate for their specific research questions.

### Condition Date Practical Applications and Use Cases
The distinction between these temporal concepts becomes most apparent when considering their respective applications in healthcare analytics and operations. Condition start dates serve as the foundation for clinical research initiatives, outcomes analysis projects, and temporal cohort definitions where understanding the natural history of disease is essential. These applications require temporal precision that reflects biological and clinical reality rather than administrative convenience.
Conversely, recorded dates prove invaluable for data governance initiatives, ETL validation processes, documentation pattern analysis, and regulatory compliance activities. These applications focus on understanding and improving healthcare delivery processes, audit trails, and operational efficiency rather than clinical outcomes.
