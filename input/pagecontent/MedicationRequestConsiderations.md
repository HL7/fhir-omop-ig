# MedicationRequest Resource Considerations
The FHIR MedicationRequest resource represents a prescription or order for medication, capturing the intent to prescribe rather than confirming actual medication administration or patient adherence. A fundamental challenge with MedicationRequest resources is appropriate reconciliation of administrative workflow data with clinical research requirements. When mapping MedicationRequest data to the OMOP Common Data Model's drug_exposure table, implementers should consider the inherent limitations of prescription data and apply appropriate transformation processes to prevent misinterpretation in downstream analyses. FHIR MedicationRequest resources represent prescriptions or orders that document clinical intent but do not guarantee patient ingestion, while OMOP's drug_exposure table is designed to capture confirmed patient interaction with therapeutic substances. As uch, Mapping FHIR MedicationRequest resources reflect prescriptive intent rather than confirmed drug exposure, requiring thoughtful handling to maintain data integrity while preserving research utility. OMOP conventions acknowledge this difference and allow utilization of prescriptions as drug exposure records. Appropriate utilization of the drug_type_concept to differenetiate prescribed medication records from administered medications (covered under FHIR MedicationStatemnt Resource section), medication histories, patient-reported exposures etc is required.

## Excluding MedicationRequest Intent Element
The FHIR MedicationRequest Intent field is deliberately excluded from OMOP mapping. This field captures medication order administrative workflow values such as "proposal," "plan," "order," and "instance-order," which serve care coordination and clinical decision-making but do not contribute meaningful clinical information for research purposes. This decision aligns with OMOP's focus on clinically significant events rather than process-oriented workflow data, maintaining a streamlined structure that prioritizes patient outcomes and treatment analysis over administrative context.

## Drug Type Concept ID Assignment
To address the fundamental discrepancy between medication intent/reporting and actual exposure while maintaining research utility, implementers should evaluate the source data context and consistently utilize the OMOP .(see [Type Concepts in the OMOP Common Data Model](../codemappings.md#type-concepts-in-the-omop-common-data-model ) ) This approach not only provides data source transparency, but supports informed decisions about data inclusion based on specific use case requirements. As a required field in the OMOP CDM, each drug_exposure entry must receive an appropriate classification that explicitly indicates data source characteristics. Options include differentiating between prescriptions written, prescriptions dispensed, medication history, and patient-reported exposure. 

## AuthoredOn to Start Date
The AuthoredOn field in MedicationRequest indicates when the medication was prescribed or requested by the provider. This date represents the prescriptive event rather than the initiation of actual medication use. When mapping to OMOP's drug_exposure.start_date, implementers should exercise caution. The AuthoredOn date should only be mapped to drug_exposure.start_date when no other temporal information is available, such as administration dates or patient-reported start dates. This mapping carries the assumption that the prescription date approximates when medication exposure began, though this assumption may not hold in practice due to delays in filling prescriptions, patient adherence patterns, or other factors.

### Mapping Requester to Provider
The Requester field identifies the healthcare provider who issued the medication prescription. This field maps directly to the provider_id in OMOP's drug_exposure table, establishing a clear link between the prescribing provider and the medication record. It is important to note that this mapping specifically identifies the prescribing provider rather than the individual who may have administered the medication or confirmed patient adherence. This distinction is particularly relevant in healthcare settings where prescription, dispensing, and administration may involve different providers.

## Medication Dosage Information
The dosageInstruction field within MedicationRequest provides valuable information for populating OMOP's SIG (signatura) or dose-related fields. This information captures the prescribed dosing regimen and administration instructions, which can be crucial for understanding the intended therapeutic approach even when actual adherence cannot be confirmed.

## Implementation Documentation Requirements
Clear documentation should accompany any transformation that includes MedicationRequest mappings, specifically addressing:

- The temporal limitations of using AuthoredOn dates as exposure start dates
- The distinction between prescribing and administering providers
- The need for appropriate filtering based on drug_type_concept_id
- Recommendations for handling prescription data in various analytical contexts
