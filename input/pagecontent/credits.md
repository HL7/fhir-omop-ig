Throughout this project, more than 100 individuals from over 70 organizations—representing academia, government, industry, and data standards development—contributed their decades of experience in managing Real-World Data to support the best practices proposed. We recognize that this guide establishes an important foundation, and acknowledge that many opportunities for enhancement remain. We welcome your feedback and encourage continued collaborations to more fully realize the transformative potential that these two complementary standards can bring to advancing human health.
